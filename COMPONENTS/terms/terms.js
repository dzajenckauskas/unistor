                        <span className="br"></span>
                        7.8 UNISTOR may apply a £50 handling fee for
                        any Storage Container collected that is a

                        UNISTOR for confirmation that it can be
                        stored. UNISTOR may adjust the storage,

                        price plan and collection fees if the volume
                        and/or quantity of Goods or Other Items
                        collected differs from your collection order.
                        <span className="br"></span>
                        7.11 UNISTOR may increase the storage fee
                        payable by you from time to time if any
                        Storage Container or Other Item collected:
                        <span className="br"></span>
                        7.11.1 has a combined width, height, and
                        length greater than 180cm; or

                        7.11.3 with regards to any Other Item, has
                        dimensions or weight different to that
                        communicated by you before the collection
                        takes place.
                        <span className="br"></span>
                        7.12 A change to the storage fee may apply if
                        the total number of Storage Containers or
                        Other Items in an order is changed from the
                        original order for any reason, including that
                        set out in clause 12.4. Where the total number
                        of Storage Containers or Other Items is
                        reduced, a credit may be applicable if the

                        monthly storage price of the original
                        collection order. In the event of an increase
                        in the total number of Storage Containers or
                        Other Items in the order, charges may be
                        applicable if the total monthly storage price
                        is higher than the monthly storage price of
                        the original collection order.

                        miles from the collection address, UNISTOR

                        for re-delivery of the Storage Containers or

                        them as abandoned and to destroy or otherwise

                    <p>
                        19.1 In this clause 22, UNISTOR limits its
                        liability to you in contract, tort (including
                        negligence), bailment, or otherwise for the
                        Services or any breach of this Agreement,
                        including for any loss of or damage to the
                        Goods, Other Items, or your Property
                        (including loss or damage during collection,
                        redelivery or storage).
                        <span className="br"></span>
                        19.2 You acknowledge that UNISTOR is unaware
                        of the value of the Goods or Other Items to be
                        packed, transported and/or stored and does not
                        insure or arrange insurance for your specific
                        Goods or Other Items. UNISTOR recommends that
                        you arrange your own insurance to cover the
                        value of the Goods or Other Items.
                        <span className="br"></span>
                        19.3 When UNISTOR returns your Goods or Other
                        Items to you, you must promptly examine the
                        Goods or Other Items and notify UNISTOR of any
                        loss of or damage to the Goods or Other Items
                        within two Working Days of redelivery of the
                        Goods or Other Items to you. You must notify
                        UNISTOR of any damage to Property caused by
                        UNISTOR within two Working Days of becoming
                        aware of the damage to the Property. If you
                        fail to inform UNISTOR within such time
                        periods of loss or damage to the Goods or
                        Other Items, or damage to the Property,
                        UNISTOR will not be liable to you for any loss

                        entitled to require proof of: (i) the cost
                        price and the current replacement cost of the
                        damaged or lost Goods or Other Items; or (ii)
                        the cost to repair the damaged Property or
                        area in the Property. You must respond
                        promptly to UNISTOR’s enquiries and requests
                        for information in respect of the Goods or
                        Other Items and/or Property. If you do not
                        provide UNISTOR with any information or
                        documents requested by UNISTOR within 28 days
                        of UNISTOR’s request, UNISTOR will not be

                        liability for any damage to the Property shall
                        not in any event exceed the reasonable cost of
